Reproduction of deepURL paper

This is my reproduction of the DeepURL paper.
There is the [Source Code](https://github.com/joshi-bharat/deep_underwater_localization) for the paper [**DeepURL: Deep Pose Estimation Framework for Underwater Relative Localization**, 
accepted to IROS 2020.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05523)

### Notes
1.Reproduced algorithm on Aquar dataset, including train phase and test phase.  
2.Fixed some issues.  
3.Add some code notes.   
4.Add some label processing code.  
5.Add the validation code.   
6.Created my own AUV synthetic dataset, and applied deepURL in it.

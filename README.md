Reproduction of deepURL paper

This is my reproduction of the paper DeepURL.
There is the [Source Code](https://github.com/joshi-bharat/deep_underwater_localization) for the paper [**DeepURL: Deep Pose Estimation Framework for Underwater Relative Localization**, 
accepted to IROS 2020.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05523)

### Notes
1.In the source code,it's final_train.txt has some errors between the center points coordinates and one of the corner coordinates.  
2.Add some code notes.  
3.Add some label processing code.  
4.Add the validation code when training.
